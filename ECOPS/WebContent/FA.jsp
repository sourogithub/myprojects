Later on it was formalized as an agency of the Government   of India to investigate into allegations of corruption in various wings of the   Government of India by enacting the <a href="aboutus/dspe.php"><strong>Delhi Special   Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946 </strong></a>. In 1963, the Central Bureau of   Investigation (CBI) was established by the Government of India with a view to   investigate serious crimes related to Defence of India, corruption in high   places, serious fraud, cheating and embezzlement and social crime, particularly   of hoarding, black-marketing and profiteering in essential commodities, having   all-India and inter-state ramifications. CBI derives its legal powers to   investigate crime from the DSPE Act, 1946. </p>

                  <p align="left">The laws under which CBI can investigate Crime are notified by   the Central Government under section 3 of the DSPE Act.</p>

CBI does not take up investigation of   general and routine nature of crime as the Police forces of the State and Union   Territories are meant to investigate such crime. </p>
                  <p align="left">As far as crime of corruption by Public Servants of the Central   Government is concerned, an individual can approach any anti-corruption branch   of CBI nearest to him, anywhere in the country. CBI has such branches in all the   State Capitals and many other cities. </p>
                  <p align="left">CBI has branches for registration of Economic and Special Crime   offences in all the four metropolitan cities, viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and   Chennai. Any of these branches can be approached for providing information about   serious economic offences as well as serious special crimes such as drug and   human trafficking, fake currency, poaching of wild life, adulteration of drugs   and food products, organized crime having all-India/inter-State ramifications. </p>
                  <p align="left">The details of CBI branches together with their jurisdiction   are posted on this website in the link <strong><a href="network.php">'CBI Network'</a></strong>. </p>

                <p align="left">This is a valid apprehension in view of the answer to <a href="#faq07"><strong>question no. 7</strong></a> above. Most of the States in India,   however have given, what is called as the 'general consent' to the Central   Government for investigation of complaints of corruption against the public   servants under the control of the Central Government working in the States. This   means that CBI will not require prior consent in each such case and it can go   ahead with the investigation of such complaints as and when received without   referring them to the State for consent. Such consent will however require if   CBI intends to take up investigation on a complaint against the public servants   under the control of the State Government. </p>
                  <p align="left">To put it in different way, most of the State Governments have   authorized CBI to undertake investigation against employees of the Central   Government, Public Sector Undertakings and Corporations under the Control of   Government of India and Banks in their States. </p>

              <dd id="#faq14">
                <p align="left">A large part of crime unearthed by CBI of corruption and   serious offences are based on oral information provided by individuals in   confidence. CBI has a very well laid down policy of handling such information   and informants, which is followed scrupulously. The informant is only handled by   the officer to whom the information has been provided. Disclosure of the   identity of the informant cannot be demanded even by the senior officers of the   officer to whom the information has been provided. The identity of such   informant is never put in writing in any record. It is not even disclosed to the   courts. Courts also do not have powers to compel CBI to disclose the identity of   the informant. </p>
                  <p align="left">No action is initiated by CBI on such information without   subjecting them to discreet verification. While taking care that the secrecy of   the information is not leaked, such information is put to detailed verification.   It is only after ensuring that a prima facie criminal case is made out, a   criminal case is registered and further action taken. </p>

The process of catching such corrupt public servants red   handed while they demand and take bribes is popularly called the 'trap'. It is   not a legal term. A set procedure has been devised in CBI to lay a trap against   a corrupt public servant. The evidence collected during the process of trap is   placed before the court along with the charge sheet and is quite important in   securing conviction of the public servant. </p>

                <p align="left">Such money is an important piece of evidence against the   accused, to be used in the court during trail. It is seized by CBI and put up in   the court along with the charge sheet. After completion of trial, court orders   return of the money to the complainant. The money is, therefore, eventually   returned to the complainant after completion of the trial. </p>
                  <p align="left">However, keeping in view the hardships, which may be faced by   the complainant because of the deposition of the money in the court, CBI has   devised a procedure for refunding an equivalent amount of money to the   complainant after filing of the charge sheet. This is done in genuine cases   after observing certain formalities including obtaining an order from the court.   The tainted bribe money is then deposited in the public exchequer on conclusion   of trial. </p>

              <dd id="#faq18">
                <p align="left">Certainly not. Action can be taken in such situations also. As   per section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, sheer demand of bribe   is a punishable offence. That is to say that acceptance of bribe is not a   mandatory requirement to prosecute a public servant. If it can be proved in the   court by way of collection of evidence that the public servant had demanded   bribe for an official act, the public servant can be convicted. </p>
                  <p align="left">Laying of trap is just a means of collection of evidence to   prove the guilt. It is preferred because it facilitates collection of good   evidence and makes a case full proof. In the absence of trap, it is difficult to   collect evidence of demand of bribe. It, however, does not mean that laying of   trap is mandatory and nothing can be done in the absence of a trap. </p>

                <p align="left">Certainly bribe giving is also an offence as per section 12 of   the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, but only when it is given voluntarily.   The law however, protects such persons who complaint to the law enforcement   agencies soon after demand of bribe by a public servant, even if they had agreed   to the demand. Section 24 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 provides   such protection and acts of the complainant during the process of laying of   trap. No action can, therefore, be taken against complaints in such matters. </p>

                <p align="left">As mentioned in answer to question no. 19, voluntarily giving   or offering bribe is also a punishable offence under section 12 of the   Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. In such a case the honest public servant   should inform CBI as soon as such an offer is made by a person. In fact such a   bribe giver can also be caught red handed by laying a trap on the complaint of   the honest public servant. </p>
                  <p align="left">The honest public servant shall, therefore, take steps to get   such persons punished, rather than ignoring or just reprimanding them. This will   deter the unscrupulous elements from bribe giving. </p>

              <dd id="#faq21">
                <p align="left">Most certainly. Sections 8 &amp; 9 of the Prevention of   Corruption Act, 1988 punish such touts/middlemen. On getting   information/complaints against such touts/middlemen, CBI lays trap against them   with the help of the complainant or otherwise. Further CBI attempts to gather   evidence against the concerned public servant also on whose behalf the   touts/middlemen are active. Such a public servant is also punishable under   section 10 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. </p>
                  <p align="left">CBI requests the general public to provide information about   such known touts/middlemen, who are active in many public offices of the Central   Government. CBI takes steps to verify such information at its own level and   ensure action against such touts/middlemen even without a complainant. </p>

CBI requests the   citizens to provide specific details about assets and expenditure of such public   servants. Providing general and vague information, however, does not help. Upon   receiving such specific details, CBI conducts discreet verification of the same   and conducts raids at the premises of such public servants after registration of   a criminal case, if the information is found as correct. </p>

                <p align="left">CBI conducts investigations in the most professional manner. It   lays great emphasis in use of science and technology during investigations. It   requires evaluation of evidence by Forensic Laboratories and other experts such   as Government Examiners of Questioned Documents (GEQDs). This often takes time.   Many cases of CBI often require investigation abroad. Collection of evidence in   a foreign country depends on many external factors beyond the control of CBI. A   letter of request is issued to the concerned country and collection of evidence   is requested by the law enforcement agencies of that country. This adds to the   delay. </p>
                  <p align="left">In addition to above, there is multi-layer supervision in CBI.   The evidence collected is analyzed threadbare both by executive officers and law   officers at multiple levels. Because of all these factors, CBI investigations   often take time. </p>
                  <p align="left">Having said this, it is important to clarify that investigation   of trap cases are generally finished within a period of one month to three   months. Of late a great emphasis is being laid in CBI to complete investigations   at the earliest. It has been decided that investigation shall be completed   within a period of one year. </p>

CBI   Interpol can help the law enforcement agencies in tracing/locating the fugitive   so that it can make a formal request for extradition of the fugitive to the MEA. </p>
