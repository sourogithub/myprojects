This 'Java to C' Assignment is a small subset of java program having classes and objects and the objective of this Assignment is to capture this kind of small subset of java program into a procedural language C using lex and yacc, keeping the meaning of the program remain intact.
 
 In this Assignment          1.Java classes are convert to C structures.
                             2.Java objects are convert as instances of the corresponding C structures.  
                             3.Java functions are managed by creating a function pointer in the C structure with the prototype of the function and q                              providing the definition outside the  Structure.
                             4.Conversion of Instances,Assignments and calling functions from java to c are done. 

Limitations: In the code part of the java program only single line system.out.print type of code with only comments inside the print function          are parsable. Any kind of conditional statements or loops or calculations are not parsable.

  
running of .out file command:- ./a.out  -JavatoC  <javafile>
