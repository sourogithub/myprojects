Dear Intern,

Greetings!!!

We are happy to receive your application. We hope you will have a good challenging & learning experience being associated with us. Thank you for applying. 
As this is a work from home internship, we have to be very well convinced about the candidature in terms of his/her openness to learn, commitment, passion, attitude, creativity, mathematical & programming skills, analytical thinking etc. So, as a part of the selection process, kindly do the following assignment, and revert back as and when you have completed it. Last date is 30/06/2019. 

Assignment Task:-

Study the following attached research article, and build different classifiers (Naive Bayes, KNN, RF, SVM, NN) using language of your choice (Python, R). 
Use their raw datasets, and validate the results.

Present your conclusion/summary as a report. 

Note:- 
Sensor calibration is a method of improving sensor performance by removing structural errors in the sensor outputs. Structural errors are differences between a sensors expected output and its measured output, which show up consistently every time a new measurement is taken. Any of these errors that are repeatable can be calculated during calibration so that during actual end-use the measurements made by the sensor can be compensated in real-time to digitally remove any errors. Calibration provides a means of providing enhanced performance by improving the overall accuracy of the underlying sensors.


Send, the assignment as a zip file with your name as the zip file name & the category applied for. Eg: Hari_ML.zip to dmachine.solutions@gmail.com
Also, the zip should include the Code, README file, explain the way you have proceeded with the tasks providing report.


Good Luck,
Team DRMachine
