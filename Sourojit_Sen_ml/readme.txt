IN the Time_series Data folder i have found the training and testing set of sensor datas which I get after downloading the link https://zenodo.org/record/1146109#.XO5ByIgzbIU and only take a small part of the dataset which is the RF model data which cover much more data than other sets of data.

I used python language and scikit-learn library for this project. In the python files I run every classifier of ur assignment and find out the accuracy of each classifier. 

After getting the accuracy over 16 sensors for each gas namely CO,CO2,NO2,O3 for each classifier namely Bayes,KNN,RF,SVM,NN I record the classifier accuracy chart data in classifier_analysis.ods file (I made this project IN UBUNTU, SO I dont use microsoft Office).

From classifier_analysis.ods sheet I plot graphs of different classifier accuracy over a single gas sensing and I insert those plots in final document 
Summary.odt file and come to a conclusion.

Thats all about .
